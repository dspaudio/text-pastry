Text Pastry
=========

A package for the [atom.io](https://atom.io) editor for pasting a ranges of numbers.

This was inspired by the [Text Pastry plugin for Sublime Text](https://github.com/duydao/Text-Pastry)

This is the source code for the [create your own package](https://atom.io/docs/latest/your-first-package) tutorial.

KNOWN BUGS
==========
* After a custom range operation, all the multiple selection carets are lost.
* Hitting undo results in each number being deleted rather than the entire operation
* Needs a spec file?
